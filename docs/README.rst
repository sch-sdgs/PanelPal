PanelPal
========

PanelPal is designed to facilitate the creation and modification 
of BED files used for the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing 
data.

The program is structured into projects, panels and virtual panels.
Panels are intended to represent the probe set contained within a 
targeted panel. These can then be further restricted to virtual panels.
